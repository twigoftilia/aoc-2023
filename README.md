- Day 03 **
- Day 04 **
- Day 05

## Note to self on this years goal

- Only do stuff when fun/ having time. No pressure. Accept many skipped puzzles.
- Goal at least 10 of 50.
- Don't give up on one hard puzzle and stop all (hello 2022), just leave and take upcoming puzzles.
- Give time to set up project and learn other stuff. 
- Try basing on Chris' setup https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEQv-cqzbPg&t=614s . Flamegraphs looks fun!

## Day 01 1,2

Fun to get starting. Adapt to workbench, inspired by Chris B youtube video 

## Day 02 1,2

Ok, remove ton of stuff (flamegraph etc) from proj as I don't care to tweak to work witth windows. 
Must go back to linux soon. I miss you, sane dev env...
Will create a repo now.
Reduce number of files / deps from the inital setup.

## Day 03

Works fine, but a quick and not very elegant solution / implementation.

## Day 04

No comment
